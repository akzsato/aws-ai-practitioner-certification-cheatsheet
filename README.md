## Personal Notes

> [!TIP]
>
> - For an exam self-entitled as "Practitioner", I considered it a relatively rough test
> - I would consider it as a "Specialty Exam", because it implies knowledge in domains such as: endpoints, API calls, service integration, IAM, KMS, S3 and other topics required by an SA Associate Exam.
> - The AWS Skillbuilder's Exam Prep Course is very complete and provides support to face this exam with ease. There are about 6 hours of videos, in addition to a 20-question practice set. If you can have access to the Enhanced Exam Prep Course (which requires a paid subscription), it would be awesome because adds a plenty of more questions to the Practice Set, grouped by knowledge domain which will give you a clear perspective of needed domains to reinforce study. Also I would include valuable Flashcards, Lab assessment and an Escape Room game to validate your knowledge.
