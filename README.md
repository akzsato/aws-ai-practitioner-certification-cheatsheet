## Personal Notes

> [!TIP]
>
> - The [AWS Skillbuilder's Standard Exam Prep Course](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/internal/view/elearning/19554/exam-prep-standard-course-aws-certified-ai-practitioner-aif-c01) is very complete and provides support to face this exam with ease. There are about 6 hours of videos, in addition to a [20-question practice set](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/internal/view/elearning/19790/exam-prep-official-practice-question-set-aws-certified-ai-practitioner-aif-c01-english). If you can have access to the [Enhanced Exam Prep Course](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/internal/view/elearning/20536/exam-prep-enhanced-course-aws-certified-ai-practitioner-aif-c01-english-amazon) (which requires a paid subscription), it would be awesome because adds a plenty of more questions to the Practice Set, grouped by knowledge domain which will give you a clear perspective of needed domains to reinforce study. Also I would include valuable Flashcards, Lab assessment and an Escape Room game to validate your knowledge.
> - Although this exam is considered a "Practitioner" exam, I would say that it is much closer to a "Specialty" exam due to the depth of knowledge required to perform well on the exam. Things like: endpoints, API calls, service integration, KMS, IAM, S3, among other topics required by the SA Associate exam.
